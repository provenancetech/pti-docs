To initiate a Crypto Withdrawal on behalf of your user, you need to use our [withdrawal endpoint](https://fiant.readme.io/reference/withdrawal)

You can either register a withdrawal address beforehand by creating a CRYPTO Payment Information object using our [payment information endpoint](https://fiant.readme.io/reference/withdrawal), or you can specify the recipient address directly in the details of the Withdrawal.
