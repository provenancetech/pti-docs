To initiate a USD Withdrawal via Wire on behalf of your user, you need to use our [withdrawal endpoint](https://fiant.readme.io/reference/withdrawal)

You can either register a Bank Account beforehand by creating a BANK_ACCOUNT Payment Information object using our [payment information endpoint](https://fiant.readme.io/reference/withdrawal), or you can specify the bank account information directly in the details of the Withdrawal.
