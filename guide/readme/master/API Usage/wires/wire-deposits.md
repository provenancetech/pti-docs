In order to let your users deposit funds via Wire, we allow you to generate **unique** Virtual Bank Accounts for any USD Wallet. To do this, you need to use our [create VBA endpoint](https://fiant.readme.io/reference/createwalletvirtualbankaccount).

Once you've generated a VBA for your user's USD Wallet, you will be able to provide the Deposit Instructions for that Bank Account to your User using your own UI.

Finally, whenever a Wire is received into that Bank Account, it will be automatically credited to your User's wallet and you will receive a Webhook notifying you about it.
