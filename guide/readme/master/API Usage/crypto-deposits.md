In order to let your users deposit any of the Cryptocurrencies that we support, we allow you to generate **unique** deposit addresses for any Crypto Wallet. To do this, you need to use our [create Deposit Address endpoint](https://fiant.readme.io/reference/createwalletdepositaddress).

Once you've generated the Deposit Address for your user's Wallet, you will be able to provide it to your user using your own UI.

Finally, whenever a transfer is received into the wallet's deposit address, it will be automatically credited to your User's wallet and you will receive a Webhook notifying you about it.
