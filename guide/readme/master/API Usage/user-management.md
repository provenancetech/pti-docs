You need to [create your users](https://fiant.readme.io/reference/addauser) to perform any action on their behalf in the Fiant platform.

From there you can [Provide more information on them](https://fiant.readme.io/reference/mergeuserinfo) or [replace some](https://fiant.readme.io/reference/updateuser).

You can also [manage their payment informations](https://fiant.readme.io/reference/adduserpaymentinformation) (Add/Get/Delete)

Here are some code example to showcase these features.
