### REST API

The REST API is the central part of the Fiant platform. Its endpoints focus around these main areas:

- User creation and management
- User Assessment cycle management
- Transaction execution and assessment

### Backend SDKS

To facilitate integration to your backend we offer language-specific SDKS. They can be publicly downloaded here

### Elements

To simplify a secure integration to the Fiant platform, hosted forms are provided for the following use cases:

- Collection of information for the User Assessment(KYC) flow
- Collecting payment information
- Onboarding users

### Web SDK

The web sdk is a publicly available Javascript library provided to simplify the integration of the Fiant Elements in the client UI.  
It also enables the tracking of user devices and UI interactions to improve the detection of malicious behaviour.  
The [SDK page](./advanced-frontend-sdk) contains guidance on how to leverage the Fiant Web SDK.
