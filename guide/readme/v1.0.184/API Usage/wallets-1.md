### What are wallets

Wallets are required for a user to store or transact any of the supported Assets on Fiant infrastrucute.

When you [create a wallet](https://fiant.readme.io/reference/createwallet), you need to provide a currency, a wallet id and, in the case of crypto, the network you want to transact this asset on.

### Deposit instructions

To be able to deposit funds externally to your wallet, you need to generate either a [deposit address](https://fiant.readme.io/reference/createwalletdepositaddress) or a [virtual bank account](https://fiant.readme.io/reference/createwalletvirtualbankaccount).

Deposit addresses can only be generated on crypto wallets, and virtual bank accounts on USD wallets.
