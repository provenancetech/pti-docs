If you use our language-specific SDKs, you don't have to worry about the signature mechanism, as it is directly handled by the SDK

```java SDK intialization
 PTIClient sdk = new PTIClientBuilder().ptiClientId(clientId)
   .privateKeyPath(System.getenv("YOUR_PATH")).
   environment(Environment.STAGING).build();

```

If you want to do plain server-side HTTP calls, you need to look at the signed requests.

You can find our language specific sdks [here](https://github.com/provenancetech/pti-platform-sdks)
